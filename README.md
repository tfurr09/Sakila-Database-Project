# Sakila-Database-Project

This is less of a project and more an example of my experience with SQL. For my data engineering class at the University of Chicago, we had a project to write out over 60 queries on the Sakila database. 

## Files

* SQL Queries.sql

This file has all of the SQL queries from this project.

* SQL in Python.py

As part of the assignment, I also did all the SQL queries using Python. This has all the same queries as the first file, but in Python.

* SQL in Python.ipynb

Same file as above, just in a Jupyter Notebook rather than a Python file.
